# Laravel-5.4x Private Messenger

A full featured Laravel 5.4x Private Messenger service which includes multi user messaging and conversations. Perfect for any social, support or any other user communication applications.

## Laravel App Drop-in Service

This application will be a drop-in service which means you can drop it in to your application and extend it endlessly. Unlike a third party vendor package with a limited API you can alter the files, add, and extend without worrying about overwrites when a new version is released. New features and bug fixes will be posted at a site to named later so devs can build on the project as well as update alter their own code to suit. There will be blade view examples (plus a nice demo) and the asset dependencies will be shipped but no blade views will be included because you want it to fit into your layout. The application can easily fit into any html structure that you have with marginal editing needed. A feature rich API will also be included so devs can simply include the needed aspects in their own project. I decided on this approach because honestly using so many 3rd party vendor packages becomes messy and at the same time you cannot alter these packages to meet your specific needs, the drop in approach leaves everything open for your unique needs.

## Drop-in Laravel Structure

The structure will follow standard Laravel 5.4 structure IE providers. services, routes, models, controllers, facades etc
So basically this will be yours and part of your app natively to alter any which way you want
